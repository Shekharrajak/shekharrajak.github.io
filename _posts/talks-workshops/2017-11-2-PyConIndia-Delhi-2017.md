#### PyCon India Delhi 2017 : Proposal for Workshop

I am very much interested for conferences and talks/workshops and had submitted the workshop 
proposal last year(2016) as well for PyCon India. So this year 
I started the discussion for the workshop proposal earlier on the [SymPy Google mailing thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sympy/pycon$20india%7Csort:date/sympy/s6IOYvHnHxU/xiiY0vdlAQAJ) to make the workshop proposal 
interesting and improved the tutorial contents.

Since on 2016 proposal, we got the suggestion for adding SymEngine as well into the tutorial content.
So we started discussion for the same. SymEngine project GSoCers worked for the SymEngine tutorial part.
