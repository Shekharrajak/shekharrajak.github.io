#### PyCon India Delhi 2017 : Proposal for Workshop

I am very much interested for conferences and talks/workshops and had submitted the workshop 
proposal last year(2016) as well for PyCon India. So this year 
I started the discussion for the workshop proposal earlier, in the 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sympy/pycon$20india%7Csort:date/sympy/s6IOYvHnHxU/xiiY0vdlAQAJ" target="_blank">SymPy Google mailing thread</a>
to make the workshop proposal 
interesting and improved the tutorial contents.

Since on 2016 proposal, we got the suggestion for adding SymEngine as well into the tutorial content.
So we started discussion for the same. SymEngine project GSoCers, worked for the SymEngine tutorial part. 

People who took part for writting the proposal were : 

- Amit Kumar, Core Developer & GSoC-cer at SymPy
- Shekhar Prasad Rajak : NIT Warangal | Core Developer at SymPy GSoC 2016 | Solvers, Sets 
- Shikhar Jaiswal : IIT Patna | Student Developer at SymPy GSoC 2017 | SymPy - SymEngine Integration and Python Wrappers
- Ranjith Kumar : IIT Kharagpur | Student Developer at SymPy GSoC 2017 | Solvers and Sets in SymEngine

Thanks for contributing on the proposal.

**Github repo**

I extended the previous year PyCon repo : <a href="https://github.com/Shekharrajak/PyCon-SymPy-SymEngine" target="_blank">(Github repo for the tutorial resources)</a>  and modified it. We added some new contents and SymEngine tutorials added as well. 

We followed the previous year conferences.Mainly these links:
