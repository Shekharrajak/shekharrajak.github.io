##### Report :

This week was too tight for me. During this week I reported to a company.
I was travelling to banglore and reported to the company.

It took me time to reach to the location and settled down myself. I shifted to near by hotel and then long program started in the company for freshers.

Whole week freshers need to be in office for mandatory propgrams. So I hardly get time during the day and evening hours.

At night I see notifications, comments and try to fix issues in daru-view and sample rails app.

These days I was focusing on making the coverage report better by adding testcases properly. Also I was trying to improve documentation and examples & demo rails app.
