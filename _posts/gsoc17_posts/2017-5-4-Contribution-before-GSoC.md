#### SciRuby/daru

[daru](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru) (Data Analysis in RUby) is a library for storage, analysis, manipulation and visualization of data in Ruby.

daru makes it easy and intuitive to process data predominantly through 2 data structures: Daru::DataFrame and Daru::Vector. Written in pure Ruby works with all ruby implementations.

It was around Nov 2016 when I first tried daru, but because of some system dependencies in my Kali Linux system, I was not able to setup the development version. I had watched some videos on Daru presented in various conference by Sameer : [Data Analysis in RUby with daru / Sameer Deshmukh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLBGyACJJS4&t=1529s) and
[Scientific Computing in Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWZMT46FSI).
These videos shows that how we can use Daru for analysing
large/small data sets and get a tour of daru being coupled with other Ruby tools like pry,
iruby and nyaplot for interactive and standalone data analysis and plotting for gaining quick
insights into data â€” all with a few lines of Ruby code.

Then in Feb/March 2017 I setup it properly in my MacBook and started contributing. [Meanwhile Jan/Feb 2017 I had contributed Ruby/Bundler community]


#### Contribution

I always get quick response on my PRs and discussions. Slowly I understood the codebase of Daru, after reading blogs and discussions. I am always interested to contribute to an open source and this gives me a good platform.

My all the PRs to Daru repo can be found in this link : [https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pulls/shekharrajak](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pulls/shekharrajak)

- Merged [PR #312](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/312) : Where clause when data contains missing/undefined values.

- Merged [PR #313](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/313) : Removed unnecessary spaces from the all files of Daru.

- Merged [PR #314](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/314) : Defined `is_values` for Index.

- Merged [PR #315](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/315) : Defined sort for Index and sort_by_index for vector.

- Unmerged [PR #323](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/323) : Defined name attr for Index and MultiIndex.


#### Getting ready to choose a Project

March 2017 I started preparing the GSoC proposal. After these contribution the another major part was choosing a project and getting idea to improve certain module in `Daru`. I started searching for project on daru wiki page GSoC 2017 ideas and discussions
