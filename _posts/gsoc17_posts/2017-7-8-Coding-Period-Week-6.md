#### Google charts tool continue &  DataTables


##### 8 july 2017 Report:

- Working on DataTables to handle large data set. [Discussion](https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/43379/is-there-any-ruby-gem-for-the-datatables#latest)

- Testing it [here](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/datatables-sample-daru)

- [Live demo](https://shekharrajak.github.io/datatables-sample-daru/)

When you run this links : [https://shekharrajak.github.io/datatables-sample-daru/server_side/static.html](https://shekharrajak.github.io/datatables-sample-daru/server_side/static.html) , it will just load the entire data into browser so it takes too much time and your browser crashes.

Same amount of data is loading in this link: https://shekharrajak.github.io/datatables-sample-daru/server_side/server.html and it is pretty fast to load and shows data according to the scrolling.

In both link I am loading 16042100 number of rows.

I am trying to understand some concepts in DataTables then I will try it with DataFrame.

- Adding more google charts examples .

-------------------------------------------------

##### 9,10 July 2017 Report :

- Mostly working on DataTables. To draw large table smoothly. Since there is no gem right now for DataTables, as I discussed it [here](https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/comment/114087#Comment_114087).

-  I have created gem for generating the html and javascript of the table from the Ruby interface. The [repo link](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/data_tables).

- datatables.rb will be useful to generate large table from the URL(server side processing) or from the html table (client side) generated by the daru dataframe or vector.  Some example I added which is not working in [iruby notebook ](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb/blob/master/spec/dummy_iruby/Basic%20Testing%20some%20methods.ipynb)

- I also tried Rails app that is working fine . Rails app is present in spec/dummy_rails of the data_tables repo.

- Also tried some static examples in [this repo](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/datatables-sample-daru).

##### 11, 12 July 2017 Report :

- I am working on [data_tables](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb) , which will be used in daru-view table. It can handle large set smoothly.

- I have changed daru dataframe#to_html function and generating the dataframe table's `thead` and `tbody` html code separately. You can see the changes here.

The changes is in my forked daru repo: shekharrajak/daru , branch: html_table_with_id .

- I have run somoe examples and it is generating html code for the table correctly in rails application . See this PR : [https://github.com/Shekharrajak/data_tables/pull/1](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/data_tables/pull/1)

-  But I am still didn't understand why it is not working in IRuby notebook. I have tried few examples here : [http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb/tree/master/spec/dummy_iruby/](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb/tree/master/spec/dummy_iruby/)

The problem may be related to this issue : [https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/issues/133](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/issues/133)

- I am working on it and hope it will be fixed soon. Then it will be easy to use in daru-view.

##### 13 July 2017 Report :

- In javascript , generated by Datatables gem checks the `thead` and `tbody` of the table .Also it is needed to extract only the body part of the table (only rows of the table). So I have modified the table template for Vector & DataFrame and generating the `thead` and `tbody` code using method `to_html_thead` and `to_html_tbody`.

I have done these changes in this PR : [https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/366](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/366)

- One can see how I am using it in datatables in [this rails application](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb/blob/master/spec/dummy_rails/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L24).

Just clone it and do  `bundle ` , `bundle exec rails s`, you will be able to see table generated using datatables js with pagination and search features. There are many features that can be added into data_tables gem.

- Still I am not able to display the table using datatables js in IRuby notebook. I hope it will be fixed soon. The issue is : [https://github.com/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb/issues/2](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/datatables.rb/issues/2)
