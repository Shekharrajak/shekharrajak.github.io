##### Report :

- Wrote few things about daru-view in wiki page : https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru-view/wiki

- Noting down and tried to solve the issues/comments in daru-view and sample rails app.

Because of new joining to a company, attending freshers program, long training program  and shifting twice (1st in hotel for around 14 days and then to a rent room PG ) have disturbed my daily routine.

I hope after settle down properly in new place, I will be able to give time to improve daru-view coverage report, write better documentation and fix small issues .
