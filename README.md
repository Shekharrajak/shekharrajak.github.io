> March, 2016: If you're on an old version of Jekyll Now and run into a) build warnings or b) syntax highlighting issues caused by [Jekyll 3 and GitHub Pages updates](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0), just :sparkles:[update your _config.yml](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/445/files):sparkles: and you'll be set!

# Forked from Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

# My Additions :

* I already had [blog](http://s-hacker.info/blog/gsoc16/subcat.html) template. To get the feed.xml I integrated my static blog with Jekyll.

* This is partially created many things need to modify. specially `_config.yml`
and `_layout` folder.

If you want to add something new in this repo, your PR is welcome.
